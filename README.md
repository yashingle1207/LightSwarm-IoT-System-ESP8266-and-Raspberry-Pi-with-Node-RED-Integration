LightSwarm IoT System: ESP8266 and Raspberry Pi with Node-RED Integration
Overview
LightSwarm is an innovative IoT system designed to monitor, visualize, and log ambient light intensity data using a network of ESP8266 modules and a Raspberry Pi. The system dynamically elects a master device based on light intensity readings, enabling decentralized decision-making. It integrates real-time visualizations using an 8x8 LED matrix, logs activity, and provides web-based insights through a Node-RED server.

•	Raspberry Pi to ESP8266:
o	Protocol: Multicast UDP
o	Message: Reset Command

•	Raspberry Pi to Node-RED:
o	Protocol: HTTP POST
o	Message: JSON-formatted data (average readings, scaled values, master durations).
________________________________________
Workflow
1. Initialization
•	ESP8266:
o	Connects to Wi-Fi.
o	Configures onboard peripherals (LEDs, LDR sensor).
o	Joins the multicast group.

•	Raspberry Pi:
o	Configures GPIO pins, SPI for MAX7219.
o	Sets up UDP multicast listener and Node-RED server.

2. Data Collection
•	ESP8266 reads light intensity via the LDR sensor.
•	The reading is smoothed using a moving average.
•	Sensor data is broadcasted to the multicast group.

3. Master Election
•	Each ESP8266 compares its reading with received packets.
•	The highest reading determines the master.
•	Master status is indicated by the onboard LED (active LOW).

4. Data Visualization
•	Raspberry Pi:
o	Receives and processes multicast packets.
o	Displays data on the LED matrix.
o	Sends JSON data to the Node-RED dashboard.
•	Node-RED:
o	Line Graph: Displays light intensity over time.
o	Bar Chart: Shows master device durations.

5. Logging
•	Timestamps, device IDs, readings, and master transitions are logged to a text file.

6. System Reset
•	Pressing the button on the Raspberry Pi:
o	Clears logs and visualizations.
o	Sends a reset command to all ESP8266 modules.
